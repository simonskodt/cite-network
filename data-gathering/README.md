# Data Gathering Techniques

I will, in the three different subfolders, try to gather input data 
for the database via three different methods:

1. Via arXiv (hard to extract reference information)
2. Via a random generator [https://www.mockaroo.com/](https://www.mockaroo.com/)
3. Via Kaggle The query: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/citation-network-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/citation-network-dataset). 12GB JSON file.
