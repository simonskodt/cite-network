## My Overambitious Goal

The goal is to create a web application to be able to play around with academic citations.
This allows for playing around with the following different technologies:

- Maven
- Spring Framework
- Neo4J
- Web applications in Java
- Concurrency in Java

## The Initial ER-Model

Cardinality explained:

| Value (left) | Value (right) | Meaning |
|--------------|---------------|---------|
| \|o          | o\|           | Zero or one |
| \|\|         | \|\|          | Exactly one |
| }o           | o{            | Zero or more (no upper limit) |
| }\|          | \|{           | One or more (no upper limit) |
